If the highest frequency is not greater than 1, the output NO is, for example, n=3, given The string is: abcdefabcd, then all 3-grams are: abc, bcd, cde, def, efa, fab, abc, bcd. The last cd is not enough to form a 3-gram, so it is not considered. Thus, both abc and bcd appear twice, and the rest only occur once, so the output should be: 2 abc bcd
52;Given a set of integers, it is required to save the set of numbers with an array and then implement a circular movement of the array. Assuming that there are n integers, the previous numbers are shifted back by m positions, and the last m numbers are changed to the first m numbers (m &lt; n). Note that you should not use the method of first outputting the number of m, and then output the first number of nm, and do not use two arrays. It is required to implement only one array. It must be ensured that the order of the output and the order of the numbers in the array are the same when outputting the result. After learning the pointer, use the dynamic array and pointer to achieve circular movement of the array.

67;Cocktail therapy, originally referred to as &quot;high-efficiency antiretroviral therapy&quot; (HAART), was proposed by Chinese-American scientist He Dayi in 1996 to treat AIDS through the combined use of three or more antiviral drugs. The application of the therapy can reduce the drug resistance produced by a single drug, minimize the replication of the virus, and restore some or even all of the damaged immune function, thereby delaying the progression of the disease, prolonging the life of the patient, and improving the quality of life. A number of improved therapies have been proposed based on cocktail therapy. To verify whether these treatments are more effective than cocktail therapy, it can be done by clinical controlled trials. Assuming that the effective rate of cocktail therapy is x, the effective rate of new therapy is y. If yx is greater than 5%, the effect is better. If xy is greater than 5%, the effect is worse, otherwise it is called the effect is similar.

Function: Determine whether n, m is in the range of the array, if not, return 0; if it is within the range, then exchange n and m rows, and return 1. In the main function, generate a 5*5 matrix, enter the matrix data, and enter the values ​​of n, m. Call the previous function. If the return value is 0, output error. If the return value is 1, the output swaps the new matrix after n, m.
82;The monitoring room measures the patient&#39;s blood pressure every hour. If the systolic blood pressure is between 90 and 140 and the diastolic blood pressure is between 60 and 90 (including the endpoint value), it is called normal. Now, the blood pressure value of several measurements of a patient is given. , calculate the maximum number of hours a patient maintains normal blood pressure
83;Peking University implements an average grade point system (GPA) for undergraduate grades. The actual scores of the students are calculated according to different formulas according to different disciplines. The rules that have been used are as follows: Actual grade point 90-100 4.0 85-89 3.7 82-84 3.3 78-81 3.0 75-77 2.7 72-74 2.3 68-71 2.0 64-67 1.5 60-63 1.0 60 or less 0 1 . Grade point for a course = Grade point of the course * Credits for the course 2. The overall grade point = the sum of all disciplines&#39; grade points / the sum of all course credits now requires you to write a program to find someone&#39;s total grade point (GPA).

91;Write a program that asks for the string s1 of the relatives of the given string s. The relatives and friends string s1 is defined as follows: the ASCII value of the first character of the given string s plus the ASCII value of the second character, to get the first relatives and characters; the ASCII value of the second character of the given string s plus The ASCII value of the third character gets the second relative&#39;s character; and so on, until the second to last character of the given string s. The last character of the family member string is the ASCII value of the first character of the given character string s plus the ASCII value of the first character.
92;You must have heard the story of Tian Ji horse racing? If 3 horses become 1000 horses, Qi Wang still let his horses play in the order of superior to bad, Tian Ji can choose his horse race in any order. Win a game, Tian Ji can get 200 two silver, lose a game, Tian Ji will lose 200 two silver, if you do not lose, you can&#39;t win. How much money can Tian Ji win at most?
93;Enter an integer to determine whether it can be divisible by 3, 5, 7 and output the following information: (1) Divisible by 3, 5, 7 at the same time (direct output 3 5 7, a space between each number); Can be divisible by two of them (output two numbers, small first, big later. For example: 3 5 or 3 7 or 5 7, separated by spaces) (3) can be divisible by one of them ( Output this divisor) (4) Cannot be divisible by any number; (output lowercase character n)
94;Given a sequence of positive integers of length N (not greater than 500), take all of the odd numbers out and output them in ascending order.
95;In general, we can use strcmp to compare the size of two strings. The comparison method is to compare the two strings from the way to the next character (by ASCII code size comparison) until different characters appear or encounter &#39;\0&#39;. . If all characters are the same, the same is considered; if there are different characters, the comparison result of the first different characters is subject to the comparison. But sometimes, when we compare the size of a string, we want to ignore the size of the letters. For example, &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;hello&quot; are equal when ignoring the case of letters. Please write a program that implements a size comparison that ignores the case of two strings.

If they stand in a row, the boys are all on the left (from the perspective of the photographer), and in the order from short to high, the girls are all on the right, and in order from high to short, what are the effects of their group photo? Kind (all people are different in height)?
103;In data compression, a common approach is run length compression. For strings, we can record each character and the number of iterations in turn. This compression is effective for the case where the adjacent data is repeatedly repeated. For example, if the string to be compressed is &quot;AAABBBBCBB&quot;, the compression result is (A, 3) (B, 4) (C, 1) (B, 2). Of course, if the adjacent characters are less repeated, the compression efficiency is lower. It is now required to get the case-insensitive compression result based on the input string.
104;<center><img src="2756.jpg"></center> As shown in the figure above, an infinite binary tree is composed of positive integers 1, 2, 3, .... From a node to the root node (the node numbered 1) has a unique path, such as the path from 10 to the root node is (10, 5, 2, 1), from 4 to the root node The path is (4, 2, 1), and only one node 1 is included in the path from root node 1 to the root node, so the path is (1). For the two nodes x and y, assume that their path to the root node is (x <sub>1</sub> , x <sub>2</sub> , ... , 1) and (y <sub>1</sub> , y <sub>2</sub> , ..., 1) (there are obviously x = x <sub>1</sub> , y = y <sub>1</sub> ), then there must be two positive integers i and j such that starting from x <sub>i</sub> and y <sub>j</sub> , there is x <sub>i</sub> = y <sub>j</sub> , x <sub>i + 1</sub> = y <sub>j + 1</sub> , x <sub>i + 2</sub> = y <sub>j + 2</sub> ,... The problem now is that given x and y, x <sub>i</sub> (that is, y <sub>j</sub> ) is required.
